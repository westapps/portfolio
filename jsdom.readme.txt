here is a list of APIs that need jsdom:

Any browser globals like window and document
ReactDOM.render()
TestUtils.renderIntoDocument() (a shortcut for the above)
mount() in Enzyme


In contrast, jsdom is not needed for the following APIs:

TestUtils.createRenderer() (shallow rendering)
shallow() in Enzyme
Finally, jsdom is also not needed for snapshot testing.
